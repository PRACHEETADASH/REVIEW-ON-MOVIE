                A jury consisting of 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians selected "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn", spoken by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler in the 1939 American Civil War epic Gone with the Wind, as the most memorable American movie quotation of all time
                Paula Hawkins' The Girl on the Train was released in 2015 and immediately dubbed the new Gone Girl (a book which was turned into a hit movie just last year). And, while the book is not about any particular true story or crime, it is somewhat inspired by real events, or, at least, a real commute We're happy. ...
"Being the other woman is a huge turn-on, there's no point denying it: you're the one he can't help but betray his wife for, even though he loves her. ...
"I can't do this, I can't just be a wife. ...
"He loves me so much, it makes me ache.

                Uri Movie Famous Quotes Feat.

Farz Aur Farzi Mein Bas Ek Maatra Ka Antar Hota Hai.. Agar Main Apne Desh Aapne Bhaiyo Keliye Aab Nehi Ladha To Main Aapne Hi Nazar Me Farzi Bankar Rehejaunga.. Kahi Baar Jung Jeetne Ke Liye … Training Se Zyada Ek Fauji Ke Jazbaat Zaroori Hote Hai..The breakdown of the families and the loud war-cry by Vihaan's little niece shuttered many hearts. She says the motto of the Indian Army, "Shauryam… Daksham… Yuddheya…" and in response, all the soldiers shout out, "Balidaan param dharma" thrice.The action scenes are incredibly well done, and the film also has deeply emotional moments. Vicky Kaushal is excellent as protagonist Major Vihan Singh Shergill. The film reminded me to some extent of 'Eye in the sky' and '13 Hours', only this was much better. 'Uri' is a fascinating film based on actual events
